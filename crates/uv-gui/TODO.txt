TO DEVELOP (Ordered by Priority)
--------------------------------

1. Show Installed Dependencies (High Value, Foundation)
   Display the dependencies/dev_dependencies from pyproject.toml in the Project tab.
   Currently the tab shows a count but not the actual list.
   This unlocks remove/update functionality.

2. Parse Dependencies from pyproject.toml (Foundation)
   Currently extract_project_name() and extract_project_version() are very basic.
   Need proper TOML parsing to extract project.dependencies and project.optional-dependencies.

3. Remove Package (`uv remove <package>`)
   Allow removing packages from the project via the UI with a delete button on each dependency.

4. Add Package (`uv add <package>`)
   Add packages via a simple input field in the Packages tab.
   Could start with just package name input.

5. Package Search (PyPI Search)
   Search PyPI for packages to add.
   The SearchPackages action and search_bar.rs component already exist.

6. Sync Project (`uv sync`)
   Add a "Sync" button to the Project tab to sync dependencies with the lockfile.

7. Lock Project (`uv lock`)
   Add a "Lock" button to regenerate the lockfile.

8. Delete Environment
   Add a delete button on environment cards to remove virtual environments.

9. Uninstall Python
   Add an uninstall button for managed Python versions.

10. Notifications System
    The Notification type exists in state - wire it up to show success/error feedback for operations.

11. Async Operations
    Convert install_python() and create_environment() to async to prevent UI freezing.
    Both have TODO comments in the code.

12. Open Project (File Picker)
    Allow opening a different project directory via a file picker dialog.

13. Persist Settings
    Save/load settings to a config file so they persist across sessions.

14. Update Package (Single Package)
    Update a specific package to latest version.

15. Update All Packages
    Batch update all packages with available updates.

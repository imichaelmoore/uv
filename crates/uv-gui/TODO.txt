TO DEVELOP (Ordered by Priority)
--------------------------------

1. Sync Project (`uv sync`)
   Add a "Sync" button to the Project tab to sync dependencies with the lockfile.

2. Lock Project (`uv lock`)
   Add a "Lock" button to regenerate the lockfile.

3. Delete Environment
   Add a delete button on environment cards to remove virtual environments.

4. Uninstall Python
   Add an uninstall button for managed Python versions.

5. Notifications System
   The Notification type exists in state - wire it up to show success/error feedback for operations.

6. Async Operations
   Convert install_python() and create_environment() to async to prevent UI freezing.
   Both have TODO comments in the code.

7. Open Project (File Picker)
   Allow opening a different project directory via a file picker dialog.

8. Persist Settings
   Save/load settings to a config file so they persist across sessions.

9. Update Package (Single Package)
   Update a specific package to latest version.

10. Update All Packages
    Batch update all packages with available updates.
